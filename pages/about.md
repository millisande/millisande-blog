I am a 20 something who owns a switch. I know I have a very specific taste in games. Some things float my boat but many games don't. I think my interests lie in a ven diagram of strategy problems, puzzles, and story telling.

I assume that I'm not alone. So why not share my findings to save other people the effort.

Please enjoy my general musings and findings on games.

I shall be largely focused on Nintendo Switch games but may extend to other platforms in time.
