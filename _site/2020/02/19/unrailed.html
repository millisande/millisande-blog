  <h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/unrailed-switch/">Unrailed</a> is an infuriating yet fun game which is addictive because success always feels so close. It has comprehensive cooperative play support. Not everyone will love the race against time, but it definitely forces you to strategise and plan ahead.</p>

<h3 id="my-experiences-with-the-game">My experiences with the game</h3>

<p>I have lost so many unexplained hours to this game. I remember starting to play and the next thing I know I’m watching the agonising slow destruction of my blessed train blowing to small cubes as my failure taunts me. 5 hours have passed. Where did they go? Not sure, I guess I was playing unrailed.</p>

<p>The game is a simple conciet, there is an unstoppable(ish) train which is heading for the end of the track. You need to place track ahead of the train otherwise the train crashes.</p>

<p>The fun and the puzzle element is managing the resources and the route for your train. You must navigate the train through terrain that changes on each level. Each level presents new challenges in regards to terrain, but what stays consistent is needing the key ingredients of rock and wood to make your track. You can employ a local or online friend or an industrious AI to help you in your endeavours of chopping down trees, chipping away rock, firefighting, collecting special golden screws, killing bandits and making tracks.</p>

<p>I briefly played with a local friend and you have equal partnership in the endeavour. He didn’t didn’t find the game as enthralling as I did, so I ended up relying on the AI’s reliable patterns of behaviour to keep playing as much as my addiction demanded. There is also a versus game play option which I didn’t play, but I am impressed there’s more than one option for cooperative play!</p>

<p>The AI is both a bane and a pleasure to work with. You have to get pretty speedy with the controls otherwise you risk the AI putting tracks down into a dead end. I spent a lot of time screaming “Why have you done that!” and getting very upset with the little AI character. However, make sure you give the AI clear directions of where to mine, chop or lay track and it is more industrious than a normal player. I actually missed the AI whilst playing with my friend. I had to convey the planned direction of travel with words!</p>

<p>This game is very fun, and very addictive. I’ve played in the default endless mode the whole time because I have yet to crack the final terrain and until I do I’m not moving on!</p>
