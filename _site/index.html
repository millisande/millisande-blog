					<p>I am a 20 something who owns a Nintendo Switch. I seem to have a specific taste in video games, specifically games involving both puzzles and story. I struggle to find games that seem to hit that sweet spot. There must be other people with similar taste in the same boat. So this page is for them. </p>
					<p>Benefit from my prior attempts to find good games. Read my reviews and find games that hit the sweet spot.</p>
