  <h2>About</h2>
  <div class="info">
    <div><p>I am a 20 something who owns a switch. I know I have a very specific taste in games. Some things float my boat but many games don’t. I think my interests lie in a ven diagram of strategy problems, puzzles, and story telling.</p>

<p>I assume that I’m not alone. So why not share my findings to save other people the effort.</p>

<p>Please enjoy my general musings and findings on games.</p>

<p>I shall be largely focused on Nintendo Switch games but may extend to other platforms in time.</p>
